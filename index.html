                                In 1904 J J Thomson proposed his plumb pudding modal in which he states that The atom is 
                                pictured as a sphere of positive charge with negatively charged electrons embedded within 
                                it, similar to plums in a pudding

                                In 1911 Rutherford proposed his atomic modal which states that an atom consists of a tiny, 
                                dense, positively charged nucleus at its center, where most of the atom's mass is concentrated, 
                                and negatively charged electrons orbiting around this nucleus in fixed circular paths, essentially 
                                leaving most of the atom's volume as empty space

                                In 1913 Bohr proposed his atomic modal which introduced the concept of energy levels for 
                                electrons orbiting the nucleus. He explained that electrons can only occupy certain energy levels 
                                due to the quantization of energy. The energy levels are quantized in integer steps called 
                                energy levels, and the electron can only occupy a single energy level at a time. Bohr's
                                model helped to explain the stability of the hydrogen atom, which has one electron in its 
                                ground state

                        The Bohr Atomic Model explains the behavior of electrons in atoms by considering the principles of quantum mechanics. Here are some key concepts:
                        1. Electrons orbit the nucleus in fixed circular paths, known as orbitals.
                        2. Each orbital has a specific energy level, which is quantized in integer steps.
                        3. Electrons can only occupy a single energy level at a time, and the energy levels are determined by the principle of quantization.
                        4. The energy of an electron in an orbital is given by the formula E = -13.6 * Z^2 / n^2, where E is the energy in electron volts (eV), Z is the atomic number, and n is the principal quantum number.
                        5. The energy of the electron in the ground state (n = 1) is called the ground-state energy.

                        1. It provides a simple explanation of the electron's behavior in atoms.
                        2. It helps to understand the stability of the hydrogen atom and other elements.
                        3. It provides a basis for understanding other atomic models, such as the Rutherford and Quantum models.

                        3. It does not explain the photoelectric effect or the behavior of electrons in other atoms, such as those with more than one electron.
